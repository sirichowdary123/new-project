            CSS Position Types Demo
        </h1>
        <div class="parent">
            I am the ancestor of all the boxes insides me.
            Also, I am positioned <span>relatively.</span>
            What is affected if I were <span>static</span>?
            <div class="static">

            <span>static</span> positioning means
            that thus element is 
            

            <i>unpositioned</i>. It is rendered where the element is by default according to the HTML. 
            It's not participating in all the positioning fun.

            <div class="absolute">
              this <span>absolutely-positioned</span> element has <i>escaped</i> its 
              <span>static</span> parent element.</br>It is now positioned relative to its 
              nearest <span>relative</span> ancestor.
            </div>
        
          </div>
        
          <div class="relative"><span>relative</span> positioning means the element is positioned
             relative to itself. Without using the <span>top</span>, <span>right</span>, 
             <span>bottom</span>, or <span>left</span> properties, it behaves like a 
             <span>static</span> element. Try adding
            properties to move this element!
        
            <div class="absolute2"><span>absolute</span> means positioned relative to its nearest 
                <i>positioned</i> parent positioned element. Uncomment the following HTML!

              
            </div>
        
          </div>
        
          <div class="fixed">
            <span>fixed</span> positioning means that I am positioned relative to the 
            browser window a.k.a the viewport. Even if you scroll, I'll be right here. 
            PS - extra info in the HTML!
